# Lester Martin
Hey! I'm a third-year Computer Science and Economics student at Emory University, passionate about software engineering. My interests lie in web and game development, machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and workflow automation. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and am always eager to learn new technologies.

I built this personal portfolio to showcase my current projects, experience, and community involvement. Feel free to contact me if you need any further information!
